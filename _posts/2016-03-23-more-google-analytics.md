I thought it would be fun sharing some knowledge about Google Analytics with you because when you try it for the first time if you are not familiar with some concepts, it might be a little bit hard.

See below; these concepts are basics to understand how GA works:

Attribution Model
Rules that define how to assign credit for sales and conversions (The final click get the credit)

Conversion
A completed activity that you deem relevant to your business goals

Dimension
Describes characteristics of a piece of data (e.g., City name)

Event
An action that is tracked when a user interface interacts with content (e.g., download a file)

Goal
Used to monitor discrete actions and their value (e.g., purchasing $5 in products)

Hit
An interaction that sends data to Google Analytics (e.g., viewing a page)

Metric
An individual element of a dimension that can be measured as a sum or ratio

Pageview
When a page is loaded, or reloaded, in the browser

Segment
A set of users that share common attributes

Session
The period of time a user is active on your site
Default is 30 minutes

Source/Medium
Source is the origin of traffic, where medium is the category of that source (e.g., Facebook, social media)

The source of information: Lynda.com (it's that course I told you at the last post).

Tomorrow I am going to tell you what I learnt in the R-Workshop for ladies I went this evening.
See ya! :)
