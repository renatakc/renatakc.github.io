### Hello!

Yesterday was the second Hacker Rank day for Statistics challenge.
But, honestly, all challenges have been easy since now. Day 2 was about basic probability, nothing with code or functions. Just a piece of paper and a pen.

**Task #6**

Bag X contains 5 white balls and 4 black balls. Bag Y contains 7 white balls and 6 black balls. You draw 1 ball from bag X and, without observing its color, put it into bag Y. Now, if a ball is drawn from bag Y, find the probability that it is black.

It is not that difficult, but you need to spend some time to think about the solution. As I haven't finished the first day's exercises, completing all puzzles until last midnight was a personal obligation (2 of Day-1 and 3 of Day-2). I am looking forward the next tasks!

About last evening, I attended a Meetup event of Outreach Digital again, and it was fascinating, as usual. The subject was SEO & Content Marketing Workshop - How To Make Sure Your Content is Found, and its speaker was Nichola Stott (@NicholaStott). Nichola has more than 20 years of experience in technology communications, including previous experience at Yahoo!.

Let's talk about SEO, so, which means Search Engine Optimization, a concept focused on growing visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results.




SEO encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase awareness in search engines.
