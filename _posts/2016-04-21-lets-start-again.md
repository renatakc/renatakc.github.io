Shame on me!
I had not written on the blog for days!!

Considering I am working part-time and studying on evenings, attending to meet ups and having a social life, I really need to manage my time and keep writing here. So writing it's a thinking style which is essential to my learning process at the moment.

Now, let's talk about what really matters: R programming!

I've just started a new Coursera web course (11th April) about Statistical Inference, which covers mainly Statistics subjects and how to code statistics using R. The best point is they encourage you to run the SWIRL package to practice some practical exercises. The downside is you need to pay the course fees to complete the weekly quiz. But it's okay, once you have at least the SWIRL to try and it's allowed to making some mistakes while you're learning it.



If you didn't have it install yet, first of all, you need to do it!

install.packages("swirl")

Then, to run this package, you just need to open R-Studio and write in the console:

library(swirl)

Install the Statistical Inference module:
install_from_swirl("Statistical Inference")

Run SWIRL package:
swirl()

We also had another Meet Up event yesterday and it was fantastic and very informative, as usual!
The R-Ladies group is becoming stronger and noted. I think it's a great new project and can achieve high levels of engagement and quality. Take a look: R-Ladies London.



If you still don't know R-Ladies, here's a brief overview: it's a recently created Meet Up group that unites girls over London city who want to learn more about R programming language. It's free of charge and you just need to subscribe to the events. Normally, it occurs on a monthly basis and you need to rush for book your seat!

That's all, folks.
I'll tell you more about other great ideas tomorrow.

Cya :)
