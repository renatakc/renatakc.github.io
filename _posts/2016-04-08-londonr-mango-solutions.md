This week is so busy that I could not write anything for the blog every day.
Actually, I got a part-time job to save money for my 2016 plans and, to meeting new people. I mean by "meeting" is leaving home every day and talking with other folks. 

So, last Tuesday I attended to one of the LondonR events, organized by Mango Solutions, a company that offers analysis solutions, consulting, training and application development for other parties. The event was fantastic, as usual: there were many bright people, most of them is already using or learning R programming and loads of people are trying to improve processes, tools, methods, which is great! If you want to achieve further career growth, you need to spend time in networking with the "right people". It means talented, intelligent and thinking-outside-of-the-box people to acquire more knowledge and even ask for mentoring.

They also brought news regarding EARL conference in this year. The best description for the EARL is written on their website:

EARL is a Conference for users and developers of the open source R programming language. The primary focus of the Conference is the commercial usage of R across a range of industry sectors with the aim of sharing knowledge and applications of the language.


So, during the talk the most interesting subject I've heard was a company named Rosetta, which created a development platform regarding many languages that are linked (like R, Python and also Excel) and work together on the same console. It is amazing! It's like a dream because you can code in your preferred language and you don't need to translate it to another one, just grabbing all codes and to put them together, in the end, then everything operates magically.

Well, my plans are studying this weekend, so for sure I'll have more subjects to talk about soon.
That's it for today :)

See ya!
