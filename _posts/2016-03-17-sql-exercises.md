I feel that I'll achieve my goals so soon. The secret is keep walking.
(I hope!)

It's pretty difficult to write every single day in the blog. There's always another thing to do. But my goal is writing the most I can do!

Well, let's talk about SQL and some points which I learnt.

I have some basic knowledge of SQL and SQL Server. I know how to do some queries using SELECT, JOIN, INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY. However, I still need to keep learning to acquire more experience in it.

The first thing in the web course I was watching (what it is quite simple and necessary, at the same time):

SQL is primary divided into two big groups:

DML - Data Manipulation Language: Basically, it is used to manipulate the data, as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc.

DDL - Data Definition Language: It is used to define data structures, as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.

All of this, I acquired in a very nice video lesson in Lynda.com

This one is named SQL Essential Training.

But, first of all, I recommend this one for those who are beginners in database matters:
<http://www.lynda.com/Access-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Databases/412845-2.html>

After a while, I also learnt a new command named DISTINCT.
SELECT DISTINCT is for showing non-duplicated rows. It works as a GROUP BY function.

However, to have real experience you need to practice, which you can do on this website here:
<http://www.sql-ex.ru/>

It is a Russian website, but it's all written in English, don't worry.
I completed few exercises, less than 10. There are 130 basic exercises to practice, divided into four difficulty levels - from 1 (the easiest) to 4 (the more difficult).
If you don't have so many experiences with SQL statements, be prepared, because it is going to have blood and pain everywhere.

I finish my post here. Tomorrow there'll happen a jobs fair and a farewell party, but I'll do my best to write here.

See ya.
