I am very proud of me!
It was a productive day today, considering I studied for six hours and went to a Meet Up event.

Let's talk about the event first, because it is still fresh in my mind.

The event was about Google Analytics: what is it and how to use it?
Dimitris Zotos presented the talk this evening. He has a thorough understanding of owned earned and paid media, with a focus on analytics and performance. It was a great presentation! We learnt basic concepts of Google Analytics, and we also had a workshop to handle an analysis using GA.

See @dimitriszotos on the left and one of the organizers on the right side.

If you still don't know, GA is a Google service, free and open to anyone who wants to try out, to track the data from your website, like visitor traffic, sales and goals conversion and collect user information. Then, you'll be interested in what content your visitors are liking the most. It's a fantastic tool. I'll try it soon and post the results here with print screens.

Regarding the Meet Up group, its name is Outreach Digital, see the link here: http://www.meetup.com/Digital/ . All Meet Ups events are free to attend; the group is non-profit, and you can volunteer to talk or even just to help the organization. I definitely recommend it. :)

After the workshop, we had happy hour at a cool pub near the venue (I think it was Shakespeare's head, near Holborn station) and I met some very nice guys and clever, as well. It's real motivation for me, knowing good people and learning about them.

I also started learning more about GA by Lynda.com (again!). I like this website because all courses are mainly short, so you can watch and learn in a quick way.
See the course link here, if you are interested in it: http://www.lynda.com/Google-Analytics-tutorials/Google-Analytics-Essential-Training/197523-2.html

In the morning, I studied R by www.datacamp.com. It is great because you watch the video, and next, you do a test, to check if you really understood the concepts. However, the sad part is the website is not free (fair enough, everyone has bills to pay) and you can watch just the first video of the whole playlist (or you can upgrade to the premium version and watch it all :) ).

I'll post here tomorrow the code because this post is too long.

I had a great idea today, thinking about Brussels and all attacks we had in past few years. (By the way, what a sad day for them :( - Moving from Brazil to Europe made me feel more about this attacks, they are closer now). So, why not to run a regression to try to predict attacks in Europe? Of course, it is a small idea, how many people or companies had already thought about it? Maybe it is impossible when you don't have data available or considering the human behavior which sometimes is unpredictable. Well, I found a website that contains data set of all kind of attacks. At least, I will try it!

Soon, you will see some results ;D

Nice dreams,
Thank you all.
