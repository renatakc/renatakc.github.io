### Hey guys!


Well, there were no studies today. Yes, that's bad. Shame on me.
But, it was not because I was lazy. Not at all!

I was busy during all the day, booking some English lessons (Some people should be saying "Thank's, God," right now) and meeting new people at Google Campus.
Yes, let's talk about this. It was a Meetup group that organised an event to meet and talk about R programming (and eat pizza, as well).

More than 20 people attended this event to share experiences and opinions about R language.
It was very nice and enlightening to talk to other people and figure out you're not the only person doing something different which you haven't tried yet (like programming languages).

So, the group is named R-Ladies Coding Club Meetup (London) and it was created by Chiin (see her LinkedIn profile here), a very nice lady who is trying to improve her career goals and skills.

In summary, she created this group to ask experienced people to help all R beginner and boost our skills in it. :)
Let's see what happen in the next Meet Up's events. To start in a good way, I am going to run "swirl" package in R to learn more about main functions and also statistics functionalities.

See the event link below and if you're interested in it, just join the group!

See ya!
