### Yay! It is the second successive day I am writing here!

So, my plan is to create a personal project and use it as my portfolio, both to improve my CV and my skills.

**Let's take a loof at the plan:**

- Look for available data (any government website which I can find open data) and extract it
- Save the data in the database or a unique file
- Read the file/data in R or Python
- Clean the raw data and format it
- Run a regression and understand the model
- Analyse the data and build a report
- Great! It sounds a good plan to start. Now, I need to work hard, and I will be back with the results.


See ya!
